Genes are the small sections of the dna, dna is like a blueprint instructions for building
a body. 
Analogy:sheet music we have for piano, we have all these different notes in a certain
sequence and the sheet music is basically the instructions on how to create this song
but you need someone to do something with the music and that's epigentics.

You are in charge of your dna 



Epigenetic changes that are induced by environment,experience(essentially
your memory, experiences are shaped up your memory),lifestyle etc
are part of the reason why genetically identical twins can grow up to
have very different personalities . 
As twins get older, their epigenomes diverge resulting in this change on personality.

At it might not stop with this generation, most epigentic marks are erased
when egg and sperm cells are formed, but some of those imprints survive, passing
those epigenetic traits on to the next generation.
Your mother's or your fathers experiences as a child, or choices as adults could
actually shape your own epigenome.
But even though epigenetic changes are sticky, they're not permanent.
